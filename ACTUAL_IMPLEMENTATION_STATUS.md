# STARLOG MCP - Actual Implementation Status

## What's ACTUALLY Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality Working
1. **Project Initialization** (`init_project`)
   - Creates project directory structure
   - Initializes registries for rules, debug diary, and sessions
   - Creates starlog.hpi file

2. **Rules Management**
   - `add_rule` - Adds rules with categories and IDs
   - `rules` - Lists all rules
   - `delete_rule` - Removes rules by ID
   - Stores in Heaven registry

3. **Debug Diary** 
   - `update_debug_diary` - Adds diary entries with timestamps
   - `view_debug_diary` - Shows all diary entries
   - Stores in Heaven registry

4. **Session Management**
   - `start_starlog` - Starts a new session with goals
   - `view_starlog` - Shows session history
   - `end_starlog` - Ends a session with summary
   - Stores in Heaven registry

5. **Context Assembly**
   - `orient` - Loads starlog.hpi and shows project context
   - `check` - Returns project status as JSON

6. **MCP Server**
   - FastMCP-based server implementation
   - All tools exposed via MCP protocol
   - Works with mcp-use for direct tool calls
   - Installable as `starlog-server` command

## ❌ NOT Implemented (Just Placeholders)

### Brain-Agent Enforcement
- Models have `brain_agent_enforced` fields but NO actual logic
- No connection to HEAVEN-BML
- No actual rule enforcement

### GitHub Integration  
- Models have GitHub fields but marked with TODO comments
- No actual GitHub API calls
- `bug_report` and `bug_fix` flags don't do anything

### CARTON Integration
- Planned but never implemented
- No connection to CartON knowledge graph

### Advanced Features
- No actual PIS (Prompt Injection System) usage
- No TreeKanban integration for work queue
- No AUTO tagging system

## What We Have

A working MCP server that:
- Manages project documentation in three categories (rules, debug diary, sessions)
- Stores data using Heaven framework's registry system
- Provides context assembly for AI assistance
- Can be installed as a Python package
- Exposes 13 working MCP tools

## Dependencies

- `fastmcp` - For MCP server
- `pydantic` - For data models
- `heaven-framework` - For registry storage
- `mcp` - For MCP protocol

## Installation Status

✅ Package structure created (pyproject.toml, setup.py, README.md)
✅ Installed locally as development package
✅ `starlog-server` command available
✅ Works with environment variables (HEAVEN_DATA_DIR, OPENAI_API_KEY)

## Next Steps Needed

1. **For Claude Code Integration**:
   - Test with actual Claude Code .claude.json config
   - Verify MCP protocol compatibility

2. **For GitHub Publishing**:
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Push code
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

3. **For PyPI Publishing**:
   - Build distribution files
   - Upload to PyPI
   - Test installation from PyPI

## Current State

The STARLOG MCP is a **working prototype** with core documentation management features. It successfully:
- Stores and retrieves project documentation
- Provides MCP interface for Claude Code
- Uses Heaven framework's proven registry pattern

It does NOT yet have:
- Actual AI agent integration
- Real GitHub integration
- Advanced workflow features

This is a solid foundation that can be extended with the planned features in future iterations.
