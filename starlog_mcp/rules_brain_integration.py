STARLOG Rules Brain Integration

This module provides integration between STARLOG project rules and brain-agent
for intelligent rule querying during development.

Usage:
    # Auto-create rules brain for a project
    rules_brain = create_rules_brain("my_project", "/path/to/project")
    
    # Query rules during development
    guidance = query_rules_brain("my_project", "I'm writing a Python validation function")
    
    # Returns relevant rules with reasoning for the development context

# New Brain Config System Usage Examples

"""
Complete documentation of the new brain config system we implemented:

NEURON SOURCE TYPES:
===================

1. "registry_keys" - Each registry key becomes one neuron
   brain_manager_func(
       operation="add",
       brain_id="project_rules_brain",
       neuron_source_type="registry_keys",
       neuron_source="my_project_rules",    # Registry name
       chunk_max=30000
   )
   Results in neurons: registry_key:my_project_rules:rule_1, rule_2, etc.

2. "entire_registry" - Entire registry as one big neuron  
   brain_manager_func(
       operation="add", 
       brain_id="project_overview_brain",
       neuron_source_type="entire_registry",
       neuron_source="my_project_debug_diary",  # Registry name
       chunk_max=30000
   )
   Results in neuron: registry_entire:my_project_debug_diary

3. "directory" - Each file in directory = one neuron (original behavior)
   brain_manager_func(
       operation="add",
       brain_id="docs_brain", 
       neuron_source_type="directory",
       neuron_source="/path/to/docs",      # Directory path
       chunk_max=30000
   )
   Results in neurons: /path/to/docs/file1.md, /path/to/docs/file2.md, etc.

4. "file" - Single file chunked into multiple neurons
   brain_manager_func(
       operation="add",
       brain_id="large_spec_brain",
       neuron_source_type="file", 
       neuron_source="/path/to/huge_spec.md",  # File path
       chunk_max=10000                         # Will chunk file every 10k chars
   )
   Results in neurons: file_chunk:/path/to/huge_spec.md:0:10000, 10000:20000, etc.

STARLOG INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
============================

For STARLOG projects, we typically want:

- Rules Brain: neuron_source_type="registry_keys", neuron_source="{project}_rules"
- Debug Brain: neuron_source_type="registry_keys", neuron_source="{project}_debug_diary"  
- Session Brain: neuron_source_type="registry_keys", neuron_source="{project}_starlog"
- Project Overview: neuron_source_type="entire_registry", neuron_source="{project}_starlog"

BRAIN CONFIG MODEL:
==================

The BrainConfig model now supports:
- brain_name: str = None                    # Brain identifier
- neuron_source_type: Literal[...] = "directory"  # How to load neurons
- neuron_source: str = None                 # Where to load from
- chunk_max: int = 30000                   # Max chars per neuron
- directory: str = None                     # Backwards compatibility
- chunk_size: int = -1                     # Backwards compatibility

NEURON PATH FORMATS:
===================

Different neuron source types create different neuron path formats:

- registry_key:registry_name:key_name
- registry_entire:registry_name  
- /path/to/file.ext (regular files)
- file_chunk:path:start_pos:end_pos

These paths are handled by _build_enhanced_prompt_suffix_blocks() to create
appropriate prompt_suffix_blocks for the LLM context.
"""

# Future Enhancements

"""
Potential future enhancements:

1. Rule Learning:
   - Learn new rules from code review comments
   - Suggest rule additions based on common issues
   
2. Context Awareness:
   - Git branch context (feature/bugfix/hotfix)
   - Recent commit messages and changes
   - Related files being worked on
   
3. Team Integration:
   - Share rule brains across team members
   - Collaborative rule evolution and voting
   
4. IDE Integration:
   - Real-time rules suggestions in IDE
   - Pre-commit rules checking
   - Automated rule violation detection
   
5. Advanced Querying:
   - Natural language rule queries
   - Rule conflict detection and resolution
   - Rule priority and context weighting
